# Wiki

This site contains guides & notes about anything I encounter related to computer science.

This serves as notes for my later reference so I can still use this knowledge after my goldfish memory forgets it 🐠 & can also help someone facing similar situation.

## FAQs

### Why a site?
Earlier I used to use a section in notes application for this same purpose but it was getting harder to browse & having these hosted on a website meant two things:

1. Lowest amount of friction for accessing them, easier to share with others.
2. Provides me an incentive to write these a little better rather than being digital equivalents of scribble on paper.

### You made a mistake
If you find anything wrong with the content feel free to open a issue on GitHub regarding the same or even a PR with corrections.

### Nature of content
While originally created for storing guides covering particular use cases. Perhaps I'll also use it to collect some of the good resources on the internet like courses or just specialized web pages describing a certain topic in detail.
