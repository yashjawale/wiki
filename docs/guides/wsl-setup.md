# WSL Setup

Intended for someone who's getting started with WSL on their Windows machine.
For advanced users refer official documentation instead.

WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) allows you to run a Linux environment directly on your Windows machine. Follow these steps to set up WSL:
1. Open the Start menu and search for "Turn Windows features on or off". Click on the search result to open the Windows Features dialog.
2. Scroll down and locate "Windows Subsystem for Linux". Check the box next to it and click "OK" to enable the feature. Windows will prompt you to restart your computer.
3. After the restart, open the Microsoft Store app and search for your preferred Linux distribution. Some popular options include Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora. Select the distribution you want to install and click "Get" or "Install".
4. Once the installation is complete, launch the Linux distribution from the Start menu or by searching for its name.
5. The first time you launch the Linux distribution, it will take some time to set up. Follow the on-screen instructions to create a new user account and set a password.
6. After the initial setup, you will have a fully functional Linux environment running alongside your Windows system. You can use the Linux terminal to install and run Linux applications, access the file system, and perform other Linux-related tasks.
Remember that WSL is designed for developers and power users who need Linux functionality on their Windows machines. It may not be suitable for all use cases, so make sure to evaluate whether WSL meets your specific requirements.
Enjoy using WSL and exploring the Linux ecosystem on your Windows computer!
